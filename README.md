# CPSC 455 Project

CPSC 455 2022S **Team 405 Found**

## Project Description

-   The targeted users for this project are driving instructors and people seeking to get driver's licenses in BC. It provides a platform for student drivers to find ideal instructors based on locations, services they need, etc.
-   Future drivers can browse a list of instructors. They can also rate instructors. Instructors can put their information on the website to advertise their services. Users can create accounts to see their reviews/advertisements.
-   It will store profiles of driving instructors, their services, and reviews from previous students. Student drivers can choose instructors based on the information mentioned above and get in touch with the instructors.
-   One additional functionality we can add is to arrange appointments for instructors and students. We are also planning to add Google Maps API to show all the instructors in users' neighbourhoods. Adding searching/filtering is also a good idea.
